# textbook-microprojects
This is a collection of tiny projects derived from textbook prompts - to be continually added to as I work through Absolute C++ (Walter Savitch, 2016). Serving primarily as a way for me to reinforce my own learning, these files contain self-directed comments and questions interspersed throughout.

1. From 24-hour notation (from Chapter 4: Parameters and Overloading)
2. Fruit and veggie bundle (Chapter 6: Structures and Classes)
3. Hot dog orders (Chapter 7: Constructors and Other Tools)
4. Add fruits and veggies! (Chapter 8: Operator Overloading, Friends, and References)
6. Anagrams =) (Chapter 9: Strings)
7. Course list (Chapter 10: Pointers and Dynamic Arrays)
8. Credentials (Chapter 11: Separate Compilation and Namespaces)
9. Unhelpful answers (Chapter 12: Streams and File I/O)
